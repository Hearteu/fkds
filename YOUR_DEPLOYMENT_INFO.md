## 📱 Setup Supabase (Required for Uploads)

Your site will work, but to enable uploads you need to set up Supabase:

**Quick Steps:**
1. Open: [SUPABASE_SETUP.md](SUPABASE_SETUP.md) or [QUICK_START.md](QUICK_START.md)
2. Create database tables (copy/paste SQL)
3. Create storage bucket named `adventures`
4. Set storage policies

**Your Supabase credentials are already configured!**
