   - Copy your videos to `assets/videos/`

2. **Update the data:**
   - Open `lib/data/sample_data.dart`
   - Replace the sample URLs with paths to your local assets
   - Example: `'assets/images/beach_sunset.jpg'`

3. **For local files:**
   ```dart
   MediaItem(
     id: '1',
     path: 'assets/images/your_photo.jpg', // Local asset
     type: MediaType.image,
     date: DateTime(2025, 8, 15),
     description: 'Your description',
   )
   ```
